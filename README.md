# Molecular clock dating with ancient mitogenomes

Methodology for molecular clock dating using ancient mitogenomes published in ChacÃ³n-Duque _et al._, _MBE_, 2025. This repository is complementary to the methodology described in that paper.

One of the novel aspects of this methodology is the use of a series of scripts to reduce the "manual" work that is usually needed to run BEAST.

## Generation of XML files (input for running BEAST)

This is mostly based on the ```python``` script ```XMLgenerator``` (https://github.com/VanssyLi/beastXMLgenerator/tree/main) that was published along with the paper and written by co-author Wenxi Li under my supervision as a MSc student. 

> [!NOTE]
> For the methodology described here, the version 1.0 of the ```XMLgenerator``` was used (see script XMLgenerator_v1.py, attached to this repository, also written by Wenxi Li).
