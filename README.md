# Molecular clock dating with ancient mitogenomes

Methodology for molecular clock dating using ancient mitogenomes published in Chac√≥n-Duque _et al._, _MBE_, 2025. This repository is complementary to the methodology described in that paper.

One of the novel aspects of this methodology is the use of a series of scripts to reduce the "manual" work that is usually needed to run BEAST.

## Generation of XML files (input for running BEAST)

This is mostly based on the script XMLgenerator (https://github.com/VanssyLi/beastXMLgenerator/tree/main) written by co-author Wenxi Li under my supervision as a Masters student.
